# Arduino-Microphone
This is our small project on Arduino Uno micro-controller board.


# Needed Materials
    Arduino
    5 LEDs
    15 Jumper Wires
    5 (220) OHM Resistors
    Keyes Microphone
    Breadboard


# Understading of the Project
In order to run the project, you should turn on the music around microphones. Then, you can see the LEDs are on. The more you make the sound louder, the more LEDs are on. It is very amazing!
